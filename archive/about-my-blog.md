## Why Make a Blog?

**Honesty**: Social media is not the place for unbridled sharing. Here I can post what I like and share a truer version of myself than when using social media.  

**Quality**: Most of what I write is bad. If I concern myself with polish too much I'm liable not to write. I can comfortably publish bad, odd, wrong, obtuse, and disagreeable content here.  

**Writing**: I want to write more than I am now. I've built this blog to be a simple vehicle for my writing so that I can put distractions aside.  

## How I Built the Blog

My past efforts to create a blog stalled out during the implementation phase. I typically spent too much time with the website's design, my chosen framework's technical details, and optimizing my processes for maintainability. I built this version of the blog as a reaction to my past failures.  

To maximize simplicity I abandoned React, Vue, static site generators, and other popular web frameworks. I wrote the entire blog in HTML and the [Milligram CSS framework](https://milligram.io/). I wrote Python scripts for simple operations like adding new posts and updating the archive. The website is strictly composed of static files and currently sits at a mere 27.4Â kB. I use GitHub and Netlify for my web infrastructure. A GitHub merge triggers Netlify to pull updates to the live site.  

My repos are unoptimized, full of hard-coded paths, and generally absent of polish. Links below.
