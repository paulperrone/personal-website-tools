2021 is shaping up to be a busy year. I have not done much writing yet, but this post is a start. 

## Notes  
### Family  
Lucy is ten months old. She is doing well and growing up fast. With Lucy's more regular schedule Laura and I have recovered a few sleeping hours; a welcome reprieve from the sleepless nights of the past nine months.  

With almost a year of parenting under our belts we continue to joke that we're "Twilight Zone parents." Our virtual community has been engaged and supportive during the last year, but Lucy is still without an introduction to our friends and extended family.

I can say with gratitude that, with rare exception, family and friends have remained happy, healthy, and safe during a challenging year.

### Career  
I can't share much detail but my work at Gallo has been progressing well. I am grateful to be working alongside an exceptional team of developers. I hope to share more material news later this year as Nourish continues to develop.  

### Personal Projects  
The good folks from the Oracle's Elixir Discord channel have given me a number of project ideas for analyzing professional League of Legends. To date I have explored skill-expression in professional play, patch similarity with K-means clustering, and win probability using [TrueSkill](https://trueskill.org/) ratings of professional players. You can find the work I've done in my [lol-analysis GitHub repo](https://github.com/paulperrone/lol-analysis).
